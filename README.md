## Problem Statement

The project aims to analyze and visualize sales and operational performance data for a retail business using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into:

> Sales Performance: Total sales, average sales per outlet, and sales trends over time.

> Item and Outlet Analysis: Number of items sold, distribution of items by type, and sales performance by outlet size and location.

> Customer Preferences: Analysis of fat content in items purchased and its distribution across different outlet types.

> Outlet Establishment Trends: Sales trends over the years for outlet establishments.

> Geographic Insights: Performance by outlet location tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).

> Comparative Outlet Metrics: A detailed comparison of total sales, item visibility, average ratings, and average sales across different outlet types.

This analysis supports decision-making by identifying high-performing categories, understanding customer preferences, and evaluating the efficiency of different outlet types and sizes.
